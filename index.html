                <p>My name is Ali Naqvi and I am currently seeking a position as a Cybersecurity Analyst. <a href="images/Ali H. Naqvi Resume (2022).pdf">Click Here For Resume</a> <br>
                    <br>My curiosity and pursuit of knowledge for the cybersecurity field began with my role as an IT Audit Intern in 2017. Had someone asked me during my senior year of college, that I would soon be pursuing a career in Cybersecurity, I would not have believed it. However, I am glad I took the leap of faith with my internship because I quickly realized the significant role cybersecurity has on our every day lives from protecting our personal data, securing businesses across all industries, and safegaurding our infrastructure in hyper connected technological ecosystem.<br>
                    <br>My strengths include problem solving, thinking outside of the box, and promoting teamwork. I am also a self-starter who challenges myself to constantly listen, keep an open mind, and prioritize learning. Whether it is working endlessly to find a solution, connecting with the right people, or asking questions, I work hard to help the team achieve its goals. <br>
                    <br>Aside from spending time learning about cybersecurity, I also enjoy playing basketball, photography, and real estate. Growing up, I worked weekends and afterschool working with my family on residential repairs and upgrades. When I turned 18 years old, I obtained my NYS Realtor license and started working in sales as a part time job. Real estate is a passion of mine. Recently, I have been fortunate enough to work alongside a local builder constructing new homes. <br>
                    <br>Below you can find some awesome pictures of the real estate projects I have been a part of.<br>

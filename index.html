                <p>My name is Ali Naqvi and I am currently seeking a position as a Cybersecurity Analyst. <a href="images/AHN - Resume - 2022.pdf">Click Here For Resume</a> <br>
                    <br>My curiosity and pursuit of knowledge for the cybersecurity field began with my role as an IT audit intern. Had someone asked me during my senior year of college, that I would soon be pursuing a career in Cybersecurity, I may have not taken it seriously. However, I am glad I took the leap of faith with my internship because I quickly realized the significant role cybersecurity plays in our lives from protecting our personal data, securing our businessses, and safegaurding our infrastructure in a hyper connected technological ecosystem.<br>
                    <br>My strengths include problem solving, creative thinking, and promoting teamwork. I am also a self-starter who challenges myself to constantly listen, keep an open mind, and prioritize learning. Whether it is working endlessly to find a solution, connecting with the right people, or asking difficult questions, I work endlessly to help the team achieve its goals. <br>
                    <br>Aside from spending time learning about cybersecurity, I also enjoy playing basketball, photography, and real estate. Growing up, I worked weekends and afterschool with my family on construction projects and repairs. When I turned 18 years old, I obtained my NYS Realtor license and started working in sales as a part time job. Real estate has always been a passion of mine and recently, I have been fortunate enough to work alongside a local builder constructing new homes in the suburbs of Long Island NY. <br>
                    <br>Below are some awesome pictures of the real estate projects I have been a part.<br>
